basic plan:
	1. figure oout how to make a grid or player board
	2. figure out how to store changes in the player board
	via user inputs
	3. implement game of life rules on a if __name__ == "__main__"
	type set up


notes on 1:
	1. grid has been developed but I don't know how user input friendly
	it is

	2. i think one may have been a giant waste of time, who knows, at least i learned to print a neat and tidy grid

	studying battleship, seems like the mechanics will work, storage, user input, etc
